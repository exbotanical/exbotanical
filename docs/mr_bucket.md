# My software bucket list

Follows is a list of programs, software architectures, or problem statements that I want to develop and solve at some point in my career. I'll add repo links to items as I implement them.

- Lisp ([impl1](https://github.com/MatthewZito/micro-lisp), [impl2](https://github.com/MatthewZito/IDL))
  - Requirements include: standard library, closures
- novel Turing-complete language
  - Requirements include: standard library, closures, compiler, macros
- module bundler
  - Requirements include: parallel processing, plugin architecture
- package manager
  - Requirements include: peer dependency resolution, mangling, compilation steps, lifecycle hooks, caching, workspaces
- language server (preferably for C)
- text editor ([impl](https://github.com/MatthewZito/tabloid))
  - Requirements include: syntax highlighting, diffing, read/write, search
- memory-mapped database ([impl](https://github.com/MatthewZito/pageboy))
- compiler
  - Requirements include: linker, compiler macros
- browser-based implementation of multi-paxos
- memchached / caching db implementation ([impl1](https://github.com/MatthewZito/tenure), [impl2](https://github.com/MatthewZito/tenure-go))
- an implementation of RAFT
- an implementation of Multi-Paxos ([impl](https://github.com/MatthewZito/multi-paxos))
- reactivity library ([impl1](https://github.com/MatthewZito/vivisector), [impl2](https://github.com/MatthewZito/resonant))
- test harness (I'll probably just contribute to vitest)
- frontend framework (I'm thinking something like Vue SFCs but strictly with JSX)
- css utility library (or contribute to unocss)
- general purpose diffing tool
