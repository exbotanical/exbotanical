Experienced software engineer with focused industry expertise in massive scale distributed systems.

Programming is my passion and has been a liminal experience between my own human condition and the world around me. I spend a lot of time reading about, thinking about, and building software. I've conceded at this point that it's a relentless obsession. That's not for everyone, but I love meeting other people that are as into this as I am.

Outside of work, I'm really interested in compilers, linters, static analysis and build tools, operating system design, and database engines. I enjoy developing open source libraries, doing things I probably shouldn't with bash scripting, and hacking on the Linux kernel. I also enjoy writing C and have authored several C libraries for multi-tasking and async I/O (see my projects list), as well as a C server framework and a POSIX-compliant cron daemon.

My other avocations include record-collecting (predominantly Fluxus and experimental composition e.g. Lucrecia Dalt), weight-lifting, hiking with my wife and the puppies, and over-analyzing TV writing. Ancillary likes include mockbusters (basically Hollywood movie rip-offs), sustained noises, talented athletes, stoats, politics, zines, and masochistically solving Leetcode problems with x86 assembly.
