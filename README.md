Polyglot programmer, comp-sci enthusiast, sed wizard. OCD lends to a penchant for static analysis tools.

Avocationally, I'm into open source, bodybuilding, hobbyist myrmecology (ants are basically highly-optimized programs and are utterly fascinating) and film/television.
I furthermore enjoy cataloging and archiving various lists. Here's a few:

- My record collection is catalogued [here](https://www.discogs.com/user/magister_zito). I collect predominantly Fluxus, American Minimalism, New York noise and experimental. I have auxiliary collections of prog-folk, 1970s US proto-punk (think Dangerhouse records), Rock In Opposition and European post-punk (Art Bears, Recommended Records, etc), and UK Cassette Culture/DIY.
- The [Film DB](https://exbotanical.github.io/film-db/). This is a collection of films, movies, and TV I've watched (including terrible stuff - I have a morbid fascination with film production generally, so I *do* watch awful TV sometimes). I particularly enjoy 1920s and 1950s period pieces, and films adjunct to music (like [TV Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Party) or [Fishing With John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_with_John)). The Film DB is a quick and very lazily thrown together SPA that (ab)uses GitHub Gists as a database.
- Zines. I've a pretty sizeable zine collection (lots of Net.Art like [Paper Rad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Rad)). I haven't figured out how I want to document these online, but I'll have something eventually. I've a decent post-modern philosophy (even though I *really* don't like the postmodernists - hey, you should know very intimately that with which you disagree) and comp-sci collection I want to document as well. Soon.

Here's some random stats a la [AngelFire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire) circa 2005:
