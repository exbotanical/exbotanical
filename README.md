Polyglot programmer, comp-sci enthusiast, sed wizard. OCD lends to a penchant for static analysis tools. 

Avocationally, I'm into hobbyist myrmecology (ants are basically highly-optimized programs and are utterly fascinating) and film/television.
I furthermore enjoy cataloging and archiving various lists. Here's a few:

- My record collection can be found [here](https://www.discogs.com/user/magister_zito). I collect predominantly Fluxus, American Minimalism, New York noise and experimental. I have auxiliary collections of 1970s US proto-punk (think Dangerhouse records), Rock In Opposition and UK post-punk (Art Bears, Recommended Records, etc), and UK Cassette Culture/DIY. I have a massive digital archive that isn't wholly represented here, but I'm working on it.
- The [Film DB](https://exbotanical.github.io/film-db/). This is a collection of films, movies, and TV I've watched (including terrible stuff - I have a morbid fascination with film production generally, so I *do* go "there"). I particularly enjoy Nordic Noir, Asian body horror, anything 1920s (including period pieces), and films adjunct to music (like [TV Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Party) or [Fishing With John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_with_John)). The Film DB is a quick-n-dirty SPA, and it (ab)uses GitHub Gists as a database.
- Zines. I've a pretty sizeable zine collection (lots of Net.Art like [Paper Rad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Rad)). I haven't figured out how I want to document these online, but I'll have something eventually. I've a decent post-modern philosophy and comp-sci collection I want to document as well. Soon.

Here's some random stats a la [AngelFire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire) circa 2005:
