Hello! My name is Matthew Zito. Professionally, I'm a software engineer at Amazon Web Services where I design and build massive-scale distributed systems. Outside of work, I'm interested in systems programming and theoretical computer science. I'm working on my first operating system, which you can find [here](https://github.com/exbotanical/toulouse). Other fun projects I've done recently include a POSIX-compliant cron daemon [chronic](https://github.com/exbotanical/chronic), a C server framework [ys](https://exbotanical.github.io/ys/) (and partial implementation of HTTP 1.x, RFC 6265, and RFC 6454), and a text editor [tabloid](https://github.com/exbotanical/tabloid).

For more stuff, you can check out my [software bucket list](./docs/mr_bucket.md) and finally, my [personal blog](https://zito.fyi) where I predominantly write source code reviews.
