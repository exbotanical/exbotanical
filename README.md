My name is Matthew Zito. I'm a software engineer at Amazon Web Services. Lately, I'm interested in schedulers, daemons, and processes. Here you'll find all of my open source personal projects written in js, ts, c, go, java, python, kotlin, rust, ocaml, x86 assembly (prefer AT&T syntax).

For more stuff, you can check out my [software bucket list](./docs/mr_bucket.md) and finally, my [personal blog](zito.fyi) where I predominantly write source code reviews.
